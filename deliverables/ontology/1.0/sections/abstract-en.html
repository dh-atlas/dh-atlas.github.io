<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The ATLAS Ontology is an OWL 2 DL ontology, designed to effectively represent scholarly research projects and their outcomes within the Cultural Heritage domain. In particular, it focuses on highlighting the key characteristics of significant types of research products (Text Collection, Digital Scholarly Edition, Linked Open Data, Ontology, and Software), while considering their unique attributes and specifications. In so doing, it seeks to realise the potential of sharing protocols, good practices, guidelines and evaluation frameworks in the Humanities.</span>
