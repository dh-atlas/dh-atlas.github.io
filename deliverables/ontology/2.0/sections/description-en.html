<span class="markdown">At the core of the **ATLAS Ontology** are Research Products, which are represented as instances of [`schema:Dataset`](https://schema.org/Dataset), a subclass of [`schema:CreativeWork`](https://schema.org/CreativeWork) defined by Schema.org as “a body of structured information describing some topic(s) of interest.” This broad and flexible notion allows ATLAS to accommodate a wide variety of scholarly outputs—from digital editions and corpora to linked data and software—as structured entities that carry semantic and contextual meaning.

The choice of [`schema:Dataset`](https://schema.org/Dataset) reflects Schema.org’s inclusive understanding of datasets (see *[Schema.org – Data and Datasets overview](https://schema.org/docs/data-and-datasets.html)*), which extends beyond conventional tabular data to encompass collections of digital materials in diverse formats (e.g., CSV, XML, images, or domain-specific encodings). Such datasets are often hosted in open-access repositories and pose integration challenges due to their heterogeneity. The ATLAS Ontology addresses this by providing a semantically rich layer on top of these diverse outputs, enabling their consistent description and integration into larger knowledge graphs.

Following Schema.org’s model, the ontology treats the dataset not merely as raw data, but as a meaningful aggregation of structured scholarly content. This abstraction aligns with the goal of making Research Products more interoperable, discoverable, and reusable across disciplinary boundaries and technological ecosystems.

<h3 class="list" id="classes-overview">Classes overview</h3>
<span class="markdown">Building upon this central abstraction, the ATLAS Ontology articulates a network of semantic relationships that position [`schema:Dataset`](https://schema.org/Dataset) at the core of a broader conceptual ecosystem. Through a combination of hierarchical links (`rdfs:subClassOf`) and semantic object properties—such as [`schema:creator`](https://schema.org/creator), [`schema:isBasedOn`](https://schema.org/isBasedOn), `atlas:used`, and [`schema:affiliation`](https://schema.org/affiliation)—the ontology connects datasets to related entities like agents, tools, organizations, and source materials.

This graph-based structure allows ATLAS to represent not only what a Research Product is, but also how it was produced, by whom, in what institutional context, and how it relates to other scholarly outputs. The following diagram provides an overview of the core classes and semantic relations within the ATLAS Ontology, highlighting the central role of [`schema:Dataset`](https://schema.org/Dataset) and its connections to other key entities.

<h3 class="list" id="dataset-subtypes">Domain-Specific Dataset Classes</h3>
<span class="markdown">To better illustrate the semantic articulation of the different subtypes of [`schema:Dataset`](https://schema.org/Dataset) used in ATLAS, the ontology includes a structured representation of Research Product categories and their associated properties. This visual overview highlights how each type—such as Digital Editions, LOD datasets, Ontologies, and Software—extends the core concept of [`schema:Dataset`](https://schema.org/Dataset), specifying additional attributes and relationships. The diagram below provides a high-level conceptual map of these entities within the ATLAS framework.</span>

<h3 class="list" id="contextual-classes">Contextual and Access-Related Classes</h3>
<span class="markdown">Beyond the internal structure and typology of Research Products, the ATLAS Ontology also captures the broader creative and institutional context in which these products are developed and accessed. Contextual entities such as `schema:Person`, `schema:Organization`, and `schema:ResearchProject` are linked to Research Products through properties like [`schema:creator`](https://schema.org/creator), [`schema:contributor`](https://schema.org/contributor), [`schema:publisher`](https://schema.org/publisher), and [`schema:producer`](https://schema.org/producer), reflecting the human and organizational agents involved in their production.

In parallel, access-related entities—such as [`schema:SoftwareApplication`](https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication) and [`schema:WebSite`](https://schema.org/WebSite)—describe how a Research Product is made available, used, or served. These connections are essential for documenting the lifecycle, provenance, and dissemination channels of digital scholarly outputs.

The following diagram visualizes these contextual classes and their relationships, outlining how the ATLAS Ontology represents the ecosystem surrounding a Research Product.
