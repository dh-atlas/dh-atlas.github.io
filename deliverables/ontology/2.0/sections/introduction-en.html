The **ATLAS Ontology** is developed within the broader **ATLAS project** to provide a robust semantic framework for describing scholarly Research Products in the Cultural Heritage domain. While it builds on existing standards such as **Schema.org**, **DCTerms**, **FaBiO**, and **Bibframe**, it extends them with ATLAS-specific classes and properties to increase semantic precision and coverage across heterogeneous research outputs.

The ontology supports detailed, structured descriptions of products like *Digital Editions*, *Linked Open Data*, *Software*, and *3D Digital Twins*, facilitating semantic interoperability and cross-disciplinary knowledge sharing. Greater granularity is achieved through the integration and alignment of diverse ontological vocabularies, enabling meaningful connections among research entities.

For a comprehensive overview of the projectâ€™s objectives and deliverables, see the [official website](https://dh-atlas.github.io/). The [ATLAS Web Application]( https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/atlas/) offers a collaborative environment for describing Research Products based on the ATLAS Ontology as data model.
